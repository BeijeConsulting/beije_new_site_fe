      "comments2": "Beije made a very good impression on me right away and it has not changed with time. I got a permanent contract after a short training period and joined a team that welcomed me far beyond my expectations.",
      "comments3": "Beije Academy was a constructive and challenging experience: it allowed me to learn about technologies used in the working world and encouraged me to challenge myself in all circumstances.",
      "comments4": "Although it was the first Academy to be run entirely remotely, it was very well managed, both in terms of the lectures and the division of the groups into mini-projects. I think that the Academy has provided me with more than adequate preparation for working in the Java environment.",
      "comments5": "A comprehensive training and professional experience that leaves you with real and immediately applicable skills. At the Beije Talent Academy you don't just learn how to programme, but how to do it with awareness and ingenuity.",
      "comments6": "Beije Academy has been very useful for me to enter the world of work with confidence thanks to the team simulations, where I have been able to put into practice what I have studied in the Academy and in the University.",
      "comments7": "The Beije Academy has been a very important learning experience for me. I didn't think that in just three months I would have been able to learn so much to be able to work independently on complex projects. I would definitely recommend it to everyone!",
      "comments8": "Thanks to the Beije Java Academy I understood what differentiates university from the world of work and above all I understood how to manage a real project, understanding how to use the java technologies most used by companies."
