      <p ><span >Dear Data Subject,&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p ><span >Italian law requires website operators, in certain cases, to inform users about cookies and other tracking methods that may be used to record certain data each time users access a website. Since our website also uses such tools, we hereby disclose the procedures we use to collect this information.</span></p>
      <p ><span >This document is addressed to all those who interact with the web services accessible by People First S.r.l., Viale Giulio Cesare n. 71, 00192 - Rome, VAT number and tax code: 16334941008 (the &ldquo;<strong>Data Controller</strong>&rdquo;).</span></p><br />

      <p ><strong><span >WHAT ARE COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES?</span></strong></p>
      <p ><span >Like almost all websites, we use small data files that are stored on your device (&quot;<strong>Device</strong>&quot;) to record certain data whenever you access or interact with our web services (such as: websites, mobile apps, applications and tools).</span></p>
      <p ><span >The specific names and types of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies used may change over time. To help you better understand the Data Controller&apos;s rules and the use of these technologies, here are some terms and their definitions.</span></p>
      <ol start="1" >
        <li><u><span >Cookies</span></u><span >&nbsp;- Small text files (usually consisting of letters and numbers) that are stored in the memory of your browser or Device when you visit a site or view a message. Cookies allow a site to recognise a particular Device or browser. Cookies can be disabled or removed using the tools available in most browsers. Cookie preferences must be set separately for each browser you use, as each browser offers specific features and options. The different types of cookies are listed below.</span></li>

        <ul >
          <li><em><span >Technical cookies</span></em><span >: these types of cookies come from the website you are viewing and may be permanent or temporary; they can be used to store information that will be reused the next time you visit the site. They can be useful to make browsing websites quick and easy (for example, they help facilitate certain procedures when shopping online, when logging in to restricted areas, when recognising the language used to read information on the web). Depending on the service they are intended to provide, they may be temporary (they are removed from the computer when the browser is closed), or permanent (they remain stored on the computer even after closing the browser).</span></li>
          <li><em><span >Profiling cookies</span></em><span >: these are designed to create profiles on the user and are used to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the user when browsing online.</span></li>
          <li><em><span >Third-party cookies</span></em><span >: these are installed by a site other than the one you are visiting. These cookies are sent to your browser by third party companies for their own purposes such as profiling, advertising delivery or social interaction.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><em><span >Third-party cookies that are independent of the Data Controller</span></em><span >: these are installed on your browser by companies and third parties that act independently of the Data Controller for their own purposes. These cookies, including social network cookies, are used by these companies to analyse the navigation, activities and preferences of users and/or to profile them independently of the needs of the services we are providing. These cookies also include cookies from companies that are members of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), the self-regulatory organisation that develops standards and represents those involved in the online advertising industry.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <ol start="2" >
        <li><u><span >Web beacons</span></u><span >&nbsp;- Fragments of code that allow a website to transfer or collect information through the request of a graphic image; they can be used for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing website usage, monitoring and reporting on advertisements, and customizing advertisements and content.</span></li>
        <li><u><span >Similar Technologies</span></u><span >&nbsp;- Technologies that store data in the browser or Device using locally shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other web application software methods. These technologies work in all browsers. In some cases, the use of local storage cannot be fully managed by browsers, but requires management by specific tools.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p ><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
      <p ><strong><span >CATEGORIES OF COOKIES USED BY THE DATA CONTROLLER</span></strong></p>
      <div >
        <ul >
          <li ><em><span >Technical cookies&nbsp;</span></em></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p ><span >Technical cookies come from the website you are viewing and may be permanent or temporary; they are used to store information that will be reused the next time you visit the site.</span></p>
      <p ><span >These cookies are useful to us in order to make it quick and easy for you to navigate our sites or to store your login credentials for our services. Where applicable, we protect cookies and other similar technologies to ensure that only the Data Controller and/or our authorised service providers can interpret them by assigning a unique code. Your personal data is not stored in cookies or other similar technologies used.</span></p>
      <p ><span >The use of these cookies may be operationally necessary for the operation of sites, services, applications and tools. This includes technologies that allow you to access sites, services, applications and tools required to prevent fraudulent activity and improve security or to use other features such as shopping carts, saved searches or similar functions.</span></p>
      <div >
        <ul >
          <li ><em><span >Third party Analyticsl analysis cookies</span></em></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p ><span >Analyticsl analysis cookies are used to help us understand how many users are browsing and what content they like the most and to help us improve our services.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p ><span >The uses of these technologies fall into the following general categories.</span></p>
      <p ><span >Performance-related uses. We may use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies to evaluate the performance of our websites, applications, tools and services, including as part of analytics to understand how visitors use our website, to determine if they have interacted with our messaging system or viewed an item or link, or to improve our website content, applications, services or tools.</span></p>
      <p ><span >Functionality-related use. We may use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies to provide you with enhanced functionality when you access or use our sites, services, applications or tools. With these features we can, for example, identify users who access our sites or track their preferences, interests, or previously viewed items so that we can improve the presentation of content on our sites.</span></p>
      <p ><span >Among these Analyticsl analysis cookies, the Data Controller uses, for example:</span></p>
      <p ><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage?hl=it"><span >Google Analytics</span></a></p>
      <p ><span >The Owner also uses the services of Google Analytics to collect and monitor the performance of the Site in order to generate exclusively aggregate reports without carrying out any so-called single-out and, therefore, cannot identify you or track your online behaviour.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p ><span >Google Analytics uses a simple JavaScript code that is added to each page and places a cookie on your browser. The cookie, in turn, sends a hit to the Owner&apos;s Google Analytics which reports every interaction that takes place on the Site, in order to record information about the pages visited. This activity creates libraries that use HTTP cookies to track user behaviour on the Site at a purely aggregate level.</span></p>
      <p ><span >Google Analytics collects information on the number of visits to the Site, behaviour in relation to the way users interact with the various active elements, or how long users spend on average on the Site.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p ><span >These cookies are processed in an aggregate and anonymous form to monitor the most visited areas of the Site, to improve its content and to assess its correct functioning.</span></p>
      <p ><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/clarity/cookie-list"><span >Microsoft clarity</span></a></p>
      <p ><span >The Data Controller also uses the Analyticsl analysis services of Microsoft Clarity, which are carried out by installing analytics cookies (including _clsk, _clck_ and MUID) on the visitor&apos;s browser.</span></p>
      <p ><span >These cookies are inserted by the installation script that the Data Controller has installed to run Clarity, without allowing the Data Controller or Microsoft to uniquely identify individual visitors.&nbsp;</span></p><br />

      <p ><strong><span >COOKIE MANAGEMENT</span></strong></p>
      <p ><span >In compliance with the directives of Legislative Decree no. 196/2003 as amended. (&quot;<strong>Privacy Code</strong>&quot;) and, in particular, its articles 13.3 and 122.1, with reference to the provision of Identification of the simplified procedures for the information and acquisition of consent for the use of cookies of 8 May 2014, you can change at any time your preferences and any consent given to the installation of cookies - profiling and advertising - directly through the CMP (&quot;<strong>Consent Management Platform</strong>&quot;) accessible at the bottom left of the screen. The CMP adopted by the Data Controller and installed on the Site complies with the &quot;<em>Linee Guida&nbsp;</em><em>sull&rsquo;utilizzo di Cookies e di altri strumenti di tracciamento</em>&quot; issued by the Italian Data Protection Authority on 10 June 2021.</span></p>
      <p ><span >The Data Controller will keep track of the User&apos;s consent by means of a specific technical cookie, considered by the Privacy Guarantor to be a &quot;not particularly invasive&quot; tool. Through the CMP, the User may deny his/her consent and/or change his/her options regarding the use of cookies by the Controller&apos;s Site at any time.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p ><span >If consent has already been given but you wish to change the cookie permissions, you must delete them through your browser, as indicated below, otherwise those already installed will not be removed. In particular, keep in mind that it is not possible in any way to control third party cookies, so if consent has already been given previously, you must proceed to delete the cookies through your browser (dedicated section) or by requesting the opt-out directly from the third parties or through the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/it/le-tue-scelte"><span >http://www.youronlinechoices.com/it/le-tue-scelte</span></a><span >&nbsp;website.</span></p>
